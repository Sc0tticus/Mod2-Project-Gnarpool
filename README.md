* Gnarpool - Website:

Gnarpool is a website that aims to facilitate the creation and adoption of carpooling on the way up to ski resorts or other outdoor recreational locations. Users have the ability to become a Driver, become a Rider, and to create a Rides or find Rides up to their favorite outdoor locations.

* Motivation:

Traffic up the ski areas in Colorado has gotten worse year after year and has made the experience of driving up to the mountains truly awful. We believe that congestion, travel-time, and air-quality, can all be improved through the use of car-pooling, which is what motivated us to create the car-pool website, Gnarpool.

* Built Using:

  Ruby Version: ruby-2.6.1/

  Dependencies: rails-6.0.3.1/sqlite3-1.4/puma-4.1/bootsnap-1.4.2/on Mac OS Catalina

* Database creation:

  The database was created using seed data we created.
